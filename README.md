# Overview

Welcome to the Github repo for the Pathfinder 2E level finder.
This project aims to use machine learning to estimate the level of a Pathfinder 2nd edition creature from some or all of its component stats.
This README will provide a basic explanation of how to access the app, as well as how to download and install it if you would like to make run it locally.
Additionally, it will provide a brief overview of the code with links for convenient browsing of the important parts of the codebase.
